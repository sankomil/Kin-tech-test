## How to run

I am using QT version 5.15.0 with MinGW version 7.3.0 (64-bit). Please copy both the folders in the QT directory and open the project. To run, just build the project and run it.

1. D1, D2 & D3 pages have been developed.
2. Options to select on each page are working (except for 'back' button).
3. Used a combo box to implement single timeslot selection for cup.

## Remaining Tasks
